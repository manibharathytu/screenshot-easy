tried profile, service, cron

cron didnt work at all
profile made this black screen of death. it workd on system start but as soon as you press print sccreen it crashes
service also the same - when print screen pressed its dying.

it was the xsel command used by clipboardy

may be because of the account with which service runs? insufficient permission? spawning another process not allowed


to check logs.
journalctl -u screenshot -b


-----------
the reason is xsel and xclip commands can't work in headless systems. even though i have UI the service ans startup scripts run headless
